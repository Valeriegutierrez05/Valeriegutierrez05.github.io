        <p class="p">I'm a student at CCPA, I have many hobbies; including painting, I 
        like to sew and I want to hopefully one day be about to start a 
        business. </p>
        <p class="p">I've always loved many things such as education and different arts
        I like art and education because there are many ways to interpret things, being creative is a big part
        of what I love, so with education you can teach or learn in ways that may be unlike others 
        and art in itself is a wide concept and doesn't always involve paint or a brush but even cooking \
        and science can be a part of art.</p>
