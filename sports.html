        <p> I did cheer for numerous years because I really liked dance and I 
        loved the excitment of the competitions. After a while i decided to join
        something different so i joined a track team at my school and we would 
        train for more distance running like 5ks. I loved being active and moving
        around but after I left that school I had to try something new. I later
        was introduced to modeling and immediatly took fascination to the confidence
        shown by the models. For a year I took a break and again I found something new
        I saw a flier for a leadership class and I had my mom take me to see what 
        it was about. I have been going for a while now and I've been given the 
        oppurtunity to help out the people that started the whole program.</p>
