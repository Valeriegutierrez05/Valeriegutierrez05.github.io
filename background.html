        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My name is Valerie and I was born in a hospital in Berkeley but all 
        my life I've lived in Oakland. Although I was born here I'm a part of 
        my family's first generation born in the US. My dad is from
        Jalisco, Mexico while my mom if from Guanajuato. Being from Oakland and
        living here all my life has had it's ups and down but overall I feel it 
        has made me who I am today.
        </p>
        <p>Something I have wanted to do all my life and have always found
        interest in was clothes and fashion. Growing up I always wanted to dress
        differently than most people my age, I always wanted to stand out. With 
        this being said I have also faced a lot of bullying for it, no matter 
        I still loved being different and I was able to learn how to be stronger 
        than whatever was said to me. I am now able to stand up for myself more 
        overall my confidence has grown overtime.</p>
